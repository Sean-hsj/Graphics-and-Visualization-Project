There are different classes in our final project Adventure Island, and 
each of our teammate are responsible for different functionalities.

Shaojie is responsible for the controlling of characters and scoring. The
functionality of jumping doesn't work as expected at the beginning but was
finally figured out.

Yichen did the GUI and switching between different screen. Some buttons are
not positioned correctly within the screen. We found that was caused by the
improper choice of image mode.

John creates functions for the determination of collisions to obstacles and coin
collections.

All of us worked together and finished our work on time. We learned a lot from 
this final project as well.
